// Permissions is the read-model for the permissions of a specific actor.
// Permissions uses the actor and role events to project the permissions of a
// specific actor. An actor is allowed to perform a given action if either the
// actor itself was granted the permission, or if the actor is a member of a
// role that was granted the permission.
//
// In order to fully remove a permission of an actor, the permission needs to
// be revoked from the Actor itself and also from all roles the actor is a
// member of (or the actor must be removed from these roles).
//
// For example, if an actor is a member of an "admin" role, and the following
// permissions are granted and revoked in the following order:
//	1. Actor is granted "view" permission on a "foo" aggregate.
//	2. Role is granted "view" permission on the same "foo" aggregate.
//	3. Role is revoked "view" permission on the aggregate.
// Then the actor is still allowed to perform the "view" action on the aggregate.
//
// Another example:
//	1. Role is granted "view" permission on a "foo" aggregate.
//  2. Actor is granted "view" permission on the same aggregate.
//  2. Actor is revoked "view" permission on the aggregate.
// Then the actor is also allowed to perform the "view" action on the aggregate
// because the role still grants the permission its members.
